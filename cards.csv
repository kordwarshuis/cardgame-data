He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value as a form of arbitrage. In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors.

Three other block size considerations put together by @Lickyvi, student Nicosia MOOC 2020:
A. Increasing block size achieves minimal transaction throughput gain at high security cost:
After Segwit increased the block size from 1MB to 2MB in 2017, Bitcoin still only achieves <10 transactions per second but with greater pump-and-dump capability, and still has 50% fault tolerance but with greater hashrate centralization. However Layer 2 solutions like Lightning solve the problem and are being extensively used.

(https://bitcoinmagazine.com/what-is-bitcoin/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-limit)

B. The problem with signatures is transaction malleability:
""In particular, ECDSA which we are using for signatures, has an inherent problem namely you can, as a signer, as someone who has the private key, you can just change the signature into something else. This means that even with strong restrictions on what can be changed, you can never change, such as in 2-of-3 multisig, you cannot prevent only 1-of-3 from changing their signature. This is a form of malleability. The only people you want to construct the valid transactions are those who have that right, only for all of them. Separating signature data from the transaction completely solves this problem.""

","The bitcoin system has always had strong incentives to further decentralize. Therefore bitcoin is currently more decentralised than any other currency and even more dispersed than any other store of (money-related) value, like gold or diamonds. 

As new use cases emerge, decentralization improves as well. E.g. Excess energy from powerplants can only recently be converted to bitcoin in an economically feasible way. This way new players arrive and increase mining decentralization. 

With bitcoin, it is almost as if you can send value over internet for the first time, even though you don\'t really send value.

To move a large store of value, cryptocurrencies, e.g. bitcoin, has proven to be unbeatable in speed and fees.
Twitter account @whale_alert reports live the transaction of large chuck of value. E.g. a transaction of 163 $M was done in an hour and for a $1 fee.

Low value transactions carry the expectation of immediate delivery, so they need high speed networks. On-chain bitcoin transactions are still possible, but just not efficient for this use. For this kind of use you need Layer 2 solutions on top of Bitcoin: Lightning Network. For ethereum: Plasma (2019). Also note the  projects aiming to enable cross-chain transactions (Polkadot, Cosmos, Interledger).

There are development besides bitcoin that strive for high speed, high volume on-chain transaction (e.g. BCH). However, these developments need to give up one of the core design principle of open public blockchain and this is: anyone, anywhere, anytime should be able to participate, freely and uncensored in any way. As soon as you give a unique core design principle of a premature innovation like bitcoin, you should ask yourself right away \'why not use readily available alternatives?\', \'why don\'t we use a database?\'.

The bitcoin protocol itself does not need any intermediary. It has a level playing field for roles involved: users, miners, shops, developers. Dive into the wiki page, linked below, about the \'Nash Equilibrium\'.

And solving that was necessary, most importantly to fulfil bitcoin\'s design principles: immutability, decentralisation, neutrality, self-sovereignty.

Digicash had some features equal to bitcoin, but it also had features of a bank: centralised, mutable ledger, etc. Digicash wasn\'t the first cryptocurrency that had unique benefits for the world; that was, and still is, bitcoin.

However many developments (Digicash, bitgold, hashcash, etc) have contributed to the design of bitcoin, and their inventors are acknowledged widely for those facts and contributions, respectively David Chaum, @NickSzabo4, Adam Back (@adam3us).","What was the first stable coin / crypto currency that was linked to a physical gold store?|bitcoin|bitgold|+e-gold|goldcash|E-gold was a digital gold currency operated by Gold & Silver Reserve Inc.

Without this security bitcoin indeed would be useless.","Complex calculations, no, massive amoounts of simple calculations, yes, but it is not the reason why bitcoin uses energy. 

Bitcoin is secured by the energy put into Proof-of-work.
The energy use is all about \'guessing in a fair game\'. That needs some explanation:
a. The energy use is mainly directed to the very sophisticated security protocol of bitcoin. It is has got very little to do with the alleged or perceived complexity of the calculations.
b. The hash-calculation in use has very important features that we need; every single one of them to secure the bitcoin protocol:
  1. hiding feature through one way encryption - it is practically undoable to reverse the process.
  2. verification feature - it is easy, fast and cheap to perform
  3. transparency feature - open source, immutable, auditable
  4. fair game feature - puzzle friendliness of the hashing algorithm
  5. neutrally scalable - anyone with hardware and software can join
(Other taxonomy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
c. To decentralise the verification of transactions, bitcoin has a protocol based on  automatism, called mining. Anyone can be a miner. Every miner has a chance to win the game roughly every ten minutes. He/she does so by repeatedly calculating a hash. 
To developers, miners and other bitcoin experts, the mining process doesn\'t compute anything special. It merely tries to repeatedly test a random number (also referred to as a nonce) which, in combination with the resulting hashes of the transaction set and previous block hash, results in a hash with special properties.

Whether or not bitcoin uses a ‘lot’ of energy is relative to personal opinions and also relative to other uses. Is it OK for governments and banks to burn up lots of energy with their centralised surveillances and systems of control?

@avanwirdum presents an analogy about what\'s going on with the smooth talk in white papers: ""It is like a magicians trick. We are in the audience. We know that the woman on stage can\'t float in the air. It\'s an illusion. But everyone around you thinks she really does. And we\'re not allowed to look closely to see how we are fooled around. Instead we have to check every single detail, every disguise, all quick manoeuvres to unravel the secret of the illusion - from a distance. That\'s what private blockchain - and ICO salesmen - do with us, create an illusion of beneficial blockchain features that their solutions actually don\'t have.""

Clear and brief answers can, and should, be given to the simple questions that distinguish meaningful blockchains from databases, open public blockchains vs. private chains that are, in fact, distributed databases.

This is the basic question any blockchain-project / product should be able to answer right away (no beating around the bush):
What kind of trust have you effectively eliminated using proofing, signing and timestamping an open public blockchain done by relevant roles in the process (e.g. producer, transporter, retailer). If you don\'t know, then your solution needs a database - it\'s not a blockchain.

You might have a real, interesting challenge to solve, but most probably blockchain is not the part of the answer. Use the tips above so that we can quickly verify that you\'re on the right track.

In many ways, answering this question is the whole point of this book: https://livebook.manning.com/book/self-sovereign-identity/. It lays out how and why SSI will affect almost everything we do on the Internet—day in and day out. Some of these changes may actually be as deep and profound as the Internet itself was in the 1980s and 1990s—and the Web was after that.

The fundamental reason is grounded in the term “self-sovereign identity”: it represents a shift in control. We started out trying to find a solution to the Internet’s missing identity layer; what we ended up discovering was that to solve those problems we needed a shift in control from the centers of the network—the many “powers that be”—to the edges of the network—where all of us exist and interact as peers.

This shift in control is wonderfully captured in this diagram from Tim Bouma, author of the chapter on Canada: Enabling Self-Sovereign Identity: https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*UIOiysZYCJyKdep-BAJFcQ.png
