It\'s like getting a drivers license, every lesson from start to the passing of your exam makes driving less complicated.","Bitcoin is not only technically complicated, it is also widespread. The bitcoin ecosystem and its influence encompasses various aspects of life: economy, banking, power, politics, ethics, trust, freedom, privacy, self-sovereignty and a few more.

Because bitcoin affects so many people directly and indirectly, it is comprehensive. Bitcoin has decentralization, an effect that certainly affects current power. Actors of the current power structure have a lot of media support (follow the money) and a lot of influence (follow the instructions) to misinform people and add to the complexity that the field already has by nature.

So it\'s complicated, but bitcoin is not too complicated. The word \'too\' could point to a choice you\'d have. But there is not choice. The innovation that bitcoin has introduced won\'t go away. The wheel did not go away, neither did the plane, the car or the internet. Get used to it.",,,,"Embrace complexity!

You can purchase or earn just fractions of a bitcoin.," Bitcoin is so different from the money we\'re used to. You could own or transfer tiny portions it. The denomination is not fixed as we know from the dollar or euro. On the other side of the spectrum there are are no 100 - or 1000 bitcoin bills.

Unlike fiat currencies, e.g. $ and £, you can buy and earn small fractions of bitcoin; you don\'t need to buy a whole bitcoin. Choose any amount you like: e.g. 0.1 bitcoin, 0.02 bitcoin. 
However, be sure that you only pay a proportional amount of fees. In 2019 you could purchase 0.001 bitcoin to store by yourself (avg. corresponding amount was 6 euro) by only paying a few eurocents fee to miners and exchanges.

But, agreed, you have to know what you\'re doing when you purchase smaller fractions of bitcoin. We invite you to check the web for free to get a deeper understanding.

Another way to get portions of bitcoin is to ask people to pay you in bitcoin!
